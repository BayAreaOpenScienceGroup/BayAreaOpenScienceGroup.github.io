<h5>UCSF Data Library with Gabi Fragiadakis (UCSF)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In January we will be joined by Dr. Gabi Fragiadakis from UCSF who will discuss the development and applications of the UCSF Data Library. The Data Library is a project that aims to capture, curate, and share biological data generated on campus — enabling data search, exploration, visualization and cross-project analyses through a series of applications in available via a web browser. Dr. Fragiadakis received her Ph.D. and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University, and joined the faculty of the UCSF’s Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology in 2019. She is a member of the Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Informatics Graduate Programs, the Bakar ImmunoX Initiative, the Benioff Center for Microbiome Medicine, and the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute. She leads a computational immunology lab studying states of the human immune system across disease contexts using single-cell methods and data integration.</p>
