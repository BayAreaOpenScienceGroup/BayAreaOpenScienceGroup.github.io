<h5>UCSF Data Library with Gabi Fragiadakis (UCSF)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In January we will be joined by Dr. Gabi Fragiadakis from UCSF who will discuss the development and applications of the UCSF Data Library. The Data Library is a project that aims to capture, curate, and share biological data generated on campus — enabling data search, exploration, visualization and cross-project analyses through a series of applications in available via a web browser. Dr. Fragiadakis received her Ph.D. and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University, and joined the faculty of the UCSF’s Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology in 2019. She is a member of the Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Informatics Graduate Programs, the Bakar ImmunoX Initiative, the Benioff Center for Microbiome Medicine, and the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute. She leads a computational immunology lab studying states of the human immune system across disease contexts using single-cell methods and data integration.</p>

<h5>Developing open source air quality datasets for public health policy action with Ayako Kawano (Stanford)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
In February we will be joined by Ayako Kawano, a PhD candidate in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources at Stanford. Ayako’s research examines the impact of air pollution on population health and climate change in low- and middle-income countries using remote sensing data and machine learning methods. Ayako recently won the Stanford University Libraries Data Sharing Prize for her work publishing a long-term dataset of fine particulate matter concentrations in India, which has been used to inform public health programs and policy as well as used in further research projects.</p>
