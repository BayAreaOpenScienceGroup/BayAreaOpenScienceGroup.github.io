<h5>Developing open source air quality datasets for public health policy action with Ayako Kawano (Stanford)</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
In February we will be joined by Ayako Kawano, a PhD candidate in the Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources at Stanford. Ayako’s research examines the impact of air pollution on population health and climate change in low- and middle-income countries using remote sensing data and machine learning methods. Ayako recently won the Stanford University Libraries Data Sharing Prize for her work publishing a long-term dataset of fine particulate matter concentrations in India, which has been used to inform public health programs and policy as well as used in further research projects.</p>

<h4>March 2026 - TBD</h4>
