description: The Bay Area Open Science Group (BAOSG) completed its fourth year of programming. Each year we author an annual reflection to summarize our sessions, note common themes and make plans for the future year. In the 2024-25 academic year we offered 8 sessions with an average attendance of 22 people per session. Find the 2024-25 annual reflection on Zenodo at (this link). Past reflections are available on Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/search?q=metadata.subjects.subject%3A%22BAOSG%22).
