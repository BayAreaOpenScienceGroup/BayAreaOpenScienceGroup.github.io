## About Us

The Bay Area Open Science Group is a growing community for Bay Area academics and researchers interested in incorporating open science into their research, teaching, and learning. Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equitable and reproducible.
 
Every month the Bay Area Open Science group hosts a virtual meetup with a featured speaker from one of the three campuses who shares a project related to open science. So far speakers have discussed curating open COVID datasets, new methods for transparent peer review, and designing free educational resources on reproductive health. In addition to meetups, members can ask questions and share tips, tools, and best practices via the [community slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/bayareaopenscience/shared_invite/zt-143mx1ck2-PkM5WMagLrP1kPAY67cObg). 
 
The group is co-led by three librarians and supported by the libraries at UCSF, Stanford, and Berkeley. 

We meet on the 4th Tuesday of the month from 2-3pm via Zoom. All are welcome to attend and join the conversation!

Our goal is to build an inclusive and welcoming community for everyone, regardless of their familiarity with open science. Learn more in our [group particiption guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rK4h07B6oMWxGFTDwS8IzNat-Q7kTQqOwLrJy_evOx0/edit?usp=sharing).

### Attend an upcoming meetup
Are you curious about how people gain recognition or merit for their contributions to open science? This spring, the Bay Area Open Science Group will explore the theme, “Getting Credit for your Open Science Work.” Speakers from UC SF, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and beyond will join our discussion group to examine getting credit through multiple lenses. Please join us to explore this topic with the BAOSG community.

### Use the Open Science Team Agreements!
Want to talk about Open Science with your lab or team? We created a two-page template for teams to learn more about open science and select practices that work for them. [Find it on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7154101#.Y1v9HMHMKZw).
